What does this project do?  
It stores four forms of coordinates.  
- save a point (lon , lat)
- save one apolygen
- save a circle
- save a linestring

ðŸ’¡This project receives the input values â€‹â€‹exactly like the raw value of the camera and GPS (meter unit) and automatically converts it to a standard unit.
